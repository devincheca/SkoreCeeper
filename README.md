# SkoreCeeper
umbrella app for keeping score for games like Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, Monopoly, Gin Rummy, or anything else with score
The source code includes a jsx file for ReactJS in the browser and an index.android file for React Native on Android
Hoping to add more features that include localstorage and make improvements for React Native performance
